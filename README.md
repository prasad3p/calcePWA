Problem statement: 
1) Given mapping of nodes and their (x,y,z) coordinates in one text file and mapping of nodes and their values(displacements) in 
  another text file, create a list of nodes with coordinates and values are mapped together to all the respective nodes. Mapping should be 
  written to excel, text file and all the nodes should be accessible into the codes as a list as well.
2) Given a component ID search respective part name, center coordinates (x,y), side in spreadsheet. From the part found out, search 
  length and width of the part from another spreadsheet. 
3) Create a list of all the nodes that fall below the component (component ID) pass to the function. From the list found out, calculate 
  value of z-coordinate of the center of the component. Return the list of nodes and z coordinate of the center.
